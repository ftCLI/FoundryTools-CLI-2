# FoundryTools-CLI
FoundryTools-CLI, former known as ftCLI, is a collection of command line tools written in Python to inspect, manipulate
and convert fonts. It takes advantage of the capabilities made available by other tools such as:

* [FontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools)
* [AFDKO](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko)
* [skia-pathops](https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops)
* [cffsubr](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/cffsubr)
* [ttfautohint-py](https://github.com/fonttools/ttfautohint-py)
* [dehinter](https://github.com/source-foundry/dehinter)

The command line interface is built with [click](https://github.com/pallets/click/) and tables are rendered by
[rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

Even if not directly imported to keep the footprint as small as possible, portions of code have been copied from
[fontbakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery) and [font-line](https://github.com/source-foundry/font-line).

## Installation
FoundryTools-CLI requires Python 3.9 or later.

**Note for Windows users**: installation on Python 3.11 and later may fail due to an error while building the wheel for
the `AFDKO` dependency. This is a known issue and a workaround is to install Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition is
fine) and the `Python development` workload, selecting the `Python native development tools` optional component.

the commands below.

    # create new virtual environment named e.g. ftcli-venv, or whatever you prefer:
    python -m venv ftcli-venv
    
    # to activate the virtual environmtnet in macOS and Linux, do:
    . ftcli-venv/bin/activate
    
    # to activate the virtual environment in Windows, do:
    ftcli-venv\Scripts\activate.bat
