    Fix metadata in monospaced fonts

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/monospace

    Rationale:

    There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is monospaced or not. If
        the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced metadata should be set (as sometimes
        they mistakenly are...)

    Requirements for monospace fonts:

    * ``post.isFixedPitch`` - "Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero if the font
    is not proportionally paced (monospaced)" (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm)

    * ``hhea.advanceWidthMax`` must be correct, meaning no glyph's width value is greater.
    (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm)

    * ``OS/2.panose.bProportion`` must be set to 9 (monospace) on latin text fonts.

    * ``OS/2.panose.bSpacing`` must be set to 3 (monospace) on latin handwritten or latin symbol
    fonts.

    * Spec says: "The PANOSE definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to
    sixteen variations. Windows uses ``bFamilyType``, ``bSerifStyle`` and ``bProportion`` in the
    font mapper to determine family type. It also uses ``bProportion`` to determine if the font is
    monospaced."
    (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan,
    https://monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2)

    * ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` must be set accurately. "OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering
    monospaced fonts, at least by Windows GDI"
    (https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397)

    * ``CFF.cff.TopDictIndex[0].isFixedPitch`` must be set to ``True`` for CFF fonts.

    Fixing procedure:

    If the font is monospaced, then:

    * Set ``post.isFixedPitch`` to ``True`` (1)

    * Correct the ``hhea.advanceWidthMax`` value

    * Set the ``OS/2.panose.bProportion`` value to 9 or 3, according to the
    ``OS/2.panose.bFamilyType`` value

    * Set ``CFF.cff.TopDictIndex[0].isFixedPitch`` to ``True`` for CFF fonts

    Check that legacy accents aren't used in composite glyphs.

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/legacy_accents

    Rationale:

    Legacy accents should not have anchors and should have positive width. They are often used
    independently of a letter, either as a placeholder for an expected combined mark+letter
    combination in macOS, or separately. For instance, U+00B4 (ACUTE ACCENT) is often mistakenly
    used as an apostrophe, U+0060 (GRAVE ACCENT) is used in Markdown to notify code blocks, and ^ is
    used as an exponential operator in maths.
