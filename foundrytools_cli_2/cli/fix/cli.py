    combination in macOS, or separately. For instance, U+00B4 (ACUTE ACCENT) is often mistakenly

    used as an exponential operator in maths.

    Fix metadata in monospaced fonts

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/monospace

    Rationale:

    There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is monospaced or not. If
        the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced metadata should be set (as sometimes
        they mistakenly are...)

    Requirements for monospace fonts:

    * ``post.isFixedPitch`` - "Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero if the font
    is not proportionally paced (monospaced)" (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm)

    * ``hhea.advanceWidthMax`` must be correct, meaning no glyph's width value is greater.
    (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm)

    * ``OS/2.panose.bProportion`` must be set to 9 (monospace) on latin text fonts.

    * ``OS/2.panose.bSpacing`` must be set to 3 (monospace) on latin handwritten or latin symbol
    fonts.

    * Spec says: "The PANOSE definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to
    sixteen variations. Windows uses ``bFamilyType``, ``bSerifStyle`` and ``bProportion`` in the
    font mapper to determine family type. It also uses ``bProportion`` to determine if the font is
    monospaced."
    (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan,
    https://monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2)

    * ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` must be set accurately. "OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering
    monospaced fonts, at least by Windows GDI"
    (https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397)

    * ``CFF.cff.TopDictIndex[0].isFixedPitch`` must be set to ``True`` for CFF fonts.

    Fixing procedure:

    If the font is monospaced, then:

    * Set ``post.isFixedPitch`` to ``True`` (1)

    * Correct the ``hhea.advanceWidthMax`` value

    * Set the ``OS/2.panose.bProportion`` value to 9 or 3, according to the
    ``OS/2.panose.bFamilyType`` value

    * Set ``CFF.cff.TopDictIndex[0].isFixedPitch`` to ``True`` for CFF fonts

    """
    Decompose glyphs with transformed components.

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/transformed_components

    Rationale:

    Some families have glyphs which have been constructed by using transformed components e.g.
    the 'u' being constructed from a flipped 'n'.

    From a designers point of view, this sounds like a win (less work). However, such approaches
    can lead to rasterization issues, such as having the 'u' not sitting on the baseline at
    certain sizes after running the font through ttfautohint.

    Other issues are outlines that end up reversed when only one dimension is flipped while the
    other isn't.

    As of July 2019, Marc Foley observed that ttfautohint assigns cvt values to transformed
    glyphs as if they are not transformed and the result is they render very badly, and that
    vttLib does not support flipped components.

    When building the font with fontmake, the problem can be fixed by adding this to the command
    line:

    ``--filter DecomposeTransformedComponentsFilter``

    * Decompose composite glyphs that have transformed components.
