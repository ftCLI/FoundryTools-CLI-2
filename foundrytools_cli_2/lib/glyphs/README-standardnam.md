## Readme

Version 4.3.0 / 2020-07-26

This nametable requires FontLab 7 or higher. It uses new syntax:

- names without prefix are used as production, friendly and alternative names
- names with `>` prefix are used as friendly and alternative names
- names with `<` prefix are used as alternative names
- names with `!` prefix are used as synonyms

This table includes data from

- https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn/
- https://github.com/LettError/glyphNameFormatter
- https://github.com/schriftgestalt/GlyphsInfo

and hand-curated data compiled by FontLab. Algorithmic names (`uniXXXX`, `uXXXX` and `uXXXXX`) are not included.

Production names are compatible with the Adobe Glyph List for New Fonts (AGLFN) v1.7, with some exceptions:

| Unicode | Friendly      | Production    |
|:--------|:--------------|:--------------|
| 0x00B2  | twosuperior   | twosuperior   |
| 0x00B3  | threesuperior | threesuperior |
| 0x00B5  | micro         | uni00B5       |
| 0x00B9  | onesuperior   | onesuperior   |
| 0x0394  | Delta         | uni0394       |
| 0x03A9  | Omega         | uni03A9       |
| 0x03BC  | mu            | uni03BC       |
| 0x2126  | Ohm           | uni2126       |
| 0x2206  | increment     | uni2206       |
| 0xFB00  | f_f           | f_f           |
| 0xFB01  | fi            | fi            |
| 0xFB02  | fl            | fl            |
| 0xFB03  | f_f_i         | f_f_i         |
| 0xFB03  | f_f_i         | f_f_i         |
| 0xFB04  | f_f_l         | f_f_l         |
| 0xFB04  | f_f_l         | f_f_l         |
| 0xFB05  | longs_t       | longs_t       |
| 0xFB06  | s_t           | s_t           |

For 0x250C-0x256A, it does not use the `SF` names as production names.
